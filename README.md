# ShadowLogger

**ShadowLogger** is a stealthy Android app that uses the Accessibility Service API to monitor and capture on-screen text content — such as search terms and viewed titles — from any app, including the Google Search app. The captured data is forwarded in real-time to a Telegram chat using a bot.
